## COMMON ISSUES/BUGS/QUESTIONS
* Java Heap Size
The TNRS uses Java's default mechanism to define the maximum amount of memory accessible to its services. This might be too low for certain appications or dedicated servers, and can be changed in TNRS/scripts/batch_start.sh and TNRS/scripts/services_start.sh.
